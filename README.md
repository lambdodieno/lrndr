# lrndr
lrndr is a low-key cracked utility that spins your .obj files right in the terminal.Its not just a basic viewer; it’s all about that smooth rotation animation. If you dont wanna sweat opening Blender just to see your model flex in 3D, this tool has you covered. Its peak terminal aesthetic for devs who want their models spinning on loop without any extra bloat. Pure vibes,no cap.
